# Contributing
you shouldn't but i'm glad you have an interest in doing so.
this project contains the following things that you might
feel disappointed about:
1. poor ui design
2. electric-taped together code that will break within 1 day

if you hate these and you want to fix them, you shouldn't.
instead, you should [yell at me how and what to do here](https://github.com/kcomain/unnamed-launcher/issues/new). 

if you *still* want to fix it instead of making the responsible person to fix it, fine. [create a pull/merge request](https://github.com/kcomain/unnamed-launcher/pulls).
if you are sending me a pr, there's a few things you should take note of:

## contribution requirements
- sign commits where possible
- use conventional commits 
  - if you don't do that i will not merge your pr
- your code will be licensed under the MIT license
- you will be added as contributor in the credits
- i will provide no mental, no physical and/or no monetary support if anything happens to you when you are reading or editing this thing.

thank you <3
