# unnamed-launcher

yet another 2hu launcher

design basically stolen from [widdiful's launcher](https://www.widdiful.co.uk/touhou.html) 
and [this version](https://github.com/David-JonesDVN/Touhou-Relauncher)

_might_ work on windows, _should_ work on linux, probably will never work on macos past catalina 

## how to run?
because this is written in (sorry) python, you just need to
1. clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kcomain/unnamed-launcher
# or
git clone git@github.com:kcomain/unnamed-launcher
```
2. install all the required stuff
```bash
poetry install
```
3. and then do
```bash
python3 -m unnamed
```

alternatively you can grab executables [here (not available yet)](https://github.com/kcomain/unnamed-launcher/releases)

## runtime requirements
an operating system with 64 bit support

## build requirements
- Python 3.6+, 3.10-
